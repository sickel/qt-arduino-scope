Some usage tips:

Displayed: How many secounds are shown across the display

Sample interval:How often is the serial port polled. If the interval is too large, 
data will pile up. If more than ten measurements are waiting, they will be dircarded, the red led is then flashing.

Offset, moves the zeropoint up or down.

Synclock -still not implemented

Amplitude: Amplification factor for the signal

For a standart arduino, offset should be -200 and the amplitude 400.

Save image:Saves the current display as an image.
