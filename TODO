- selectable port
- Tear out the last parts of the "signal generator" code from the example (or maybe, make it available as a testing function?)
- Visual indications on overflow and underflow (overflow: The data comes in much faster than the acuisition rate, 
  when more than ten measurements are piled up, they are thrown away, underflow: The acuisition rate is so high that
  a large number of samples are empty or partial)

Later on:
- two channel scope - use the channels as X- and Y- axis

Also: 
- Clearify licences and show more cleary which parts are mine.
