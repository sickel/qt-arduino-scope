To install:

on linux:
install qt4-dev and qwt-dev, qextserialport

compile and install the led widget (in ./led)

run qmake, then make

the binary shows up as bin/oscilloscope

Before starting the application, run the sketch Voltmeter.ino on the arduino board

The serial port is still hardcoded. It must have the same speed in Voltmeter.ino 
and samplinthread.cpp.

I hope to be able to make a deb package out of this later on...
